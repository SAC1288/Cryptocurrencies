# Cryptocurrencies

Uilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover patterns within cryptocurrency data. First, I preprocessed the data by removing null values and unnecessary columns while also using StandardScaler to scale the data. Then I reduced data dimensions by transforming the X values into sandardized scores and only keeping the columns that explained most of the variation of the data. The technique used to do this was Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and I was able to create 3 PCAs for the analysis. After that step, I then created an elbow curve to identify the optimnal number of clusters needed for KMeans. That number turned out to be 4 and so I used in the clustering analysis. Finally, I created visuals for the data using a 3-D chart for the clusters and a 2-D chart for a PCA done for Coins Supplied and Coins Mined data columns. The results are presented in the jupyter notebook file titled "crypto_clustering".
